The Employee Attrition Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive analytical tool for understanding employee turnover within the organization. Utilizing key metrics such as Total Employees, Attrition Percentage, Active Employees, and Average Job Satisfaction, the dashboard offers a clear view of workforce dynamics. By integrating interactive slicers for Age Group, Job Satisfaction, Department, and Monthly Income, users can easily filter data and gain insights into specific segments of the workforce. The dashboard will visualize trends and correlations, empowering HR professionals and management to identify areas for improvement. This project enhances data-driven decision-making processes, ultimately fostering a more engaged and satisfied workforce. Through continuous analysis, the organization can proactively address attrition challenges and implement effective retention strategies.
